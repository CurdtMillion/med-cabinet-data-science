## Data

1. The first data source was from a [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130923143638.htm) done by the Boston Medical Center and the Boston University of Medicine, examined 589 drug usersâ€”more than 8 out of 10 of whom were pot smokers. It came to the conclusion that "weed aficionados" were no more likely to visit the doctor than non-drug users.

2. In October 2016, Phylos Bioscience released a genomic open dataset of approximately 850 strains of Cannabis via the Open Cannabis Project. In combination with other genomics datasets made available by Courtagen Life Sciences, Michigan State University, NCBI, Sunrise Medicinal, University of Calgary, University of Toronto, and Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the total amount of publicly available data exceeds 1,000 samples taken from nearly as many unique strains.
